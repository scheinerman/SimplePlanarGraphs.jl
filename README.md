# `SimplePlanarGraphs`


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scheinerman/SimplePlanarGraphs.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scheinerman/SimplePlanarGraphs.jl)


Experimental (for now) place to try out planarity algorithms 
in support of `SimpleGraphs`. 

**Caveat Emptor**: This code is not ready for prime time!

## Functions

* `count_cross(G)` counts the number of crossings in the `xy`-embedding 
of the graph `G`.
